# Triple-S
## A Software Project using Flutter and UML Diagrams from A to Z.
#### Our project represent a healthcare app, That you use it to calculate your BMI (Body Math Index) to know in which category you are.
## And what's BMI ?
#### The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.

## Accuracy of BMI
BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a healthy weight range for a particular height.

As well as measuring your BMI, healthcare professionals may take other factors into account when assessing if you're a healthy weight.

Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy weight even though their BMI is classed as obese.

Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health conditions. For example, adults of South Asian origin may have a higher risk of some health problems, such as diabetes, with a BMI of 23, which is usually considered healthy.

You should not use BMI as a measure if you're pregnant. Get advice from your midwife or GP if you're concerned about your weight.

## BMI ranges:
- below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range.
- between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range.
- between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range.
- 30 or over – you're in the obese range.

####  So here in our app, We will keep monitor your weight to keep you healthy by giving you some systems of foods, And make you do some workouts, And you have the choice to track your progress with a doctor.

## Some UML_Models that we creat in this app:

### In this usecase we define the some functions and the inputs such as:
### user :
- input weight, height, gender, etc ...
### admin (couch or doctor):
- add systems, workouts,track patients, etc ..

#### This Uml explains the stages the user goes through when they log on to Triple SSS. When they open to me, the software shows them a welcome message, and then requires them to enter their user name, Jemel, and phone number to verify the user's health and to preserve their data. If the user first has access to the software, they create their own page to preserve their data, so all data is saved in Data Base. The next stage the program opens to the user after the data is checked, and a number of questions are asked The user's height, weight, type, and if they have any chronic disease? And this data is stored in the data warehouse, and the next stage shows the user what kind of diet they have, and then shows them if they want to be sold with a doctor or not. In case he wants to reach out to Dr. Pittem, set up a special channel to get the doctor to the patient, in case he doesn't get asked if he wants to exercise or not? If he wants to play, should I ask him if he wants to play in the house or the gym? If he wants to play at home, he will be shown videos suitable for him. He will also have access to the instructor's number and data if he wants to follow with his own coach, if he does not want to follow with his own doctor, who will be offered a proper diet.       

#### There is a lot of UML models i will leave it in folder with the app if anyone want to see it.
